# calculator

## Preview: 
- [Live version](https://natashachiu.github.io/calculator/)

## Features:
* Basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* “+/-“ turns a number on the display positive or negative
* “DEL” works as a backspace
* “AC” resets the operation and display
* Keyboard input for all buttons on the calculator

## Limitations:
* Doesn’t handle numbers larger than the display size
* Cannot access operators and previous numbers selected
* Doesn’t follow typical order of operations (e.g. multiplication before addition)
* Not responsive to different screens

## New tools I learnt:
* pseudo classes for CSS (:hover, :active)
* adding event listeners to window to detect keyboard input
